SCPN Dense Plasma Focus Core — ADR 0002: device configuration model

# ADR 0002 — Device configuration model and evidence-maturity semantics

**Status:** accepted (2026-08-31)

**Deciders:** project owner; SCPN Reactor Systems Research Group standard

## Context

The repository was established architecture-only (ADR 0001). The first
capability lane is the device configuration model for the single
registry configuration this repository owns (`dense_plasma_focus`). The
claim boundary and repository-level `evidence_maturity` semantics
follow the family pilot.

## Decision

1. The package `scpn_dense_plasma_focus_core` implements the device
   configuration model as frozen, strictly typed value objects: the
   coaxial electrode set (anode/cathode radii, anode length) and the
   bank/fill declaration (bank energy, peak current, fill pressure,
   fill-gas class).
2. Claim boundary — identical to the family pilot: internal-consistency
   validation, cited textbook estimates with documented bounds,
   canonical serialisation with SHA-256 digest, and the data-only SPO
   registry pin. No claim about any real machine; every exercised
   parameter set is a synthetic test fixture.
3. Hard invariant: the cathode radius is strictly larger than the anode
   radius — the coaxial-gun geometry of the Mather/Filippov family.
4. Derived quantity with citation: the drive parameter
   ``S = I_peak / (a sqrt(p))`` in kA cm^-1 Torr^-1/2 (S. Lee,
   A. Serban, IEEE Trans. Plasma Sci. 24 (1996) 1101). Advisory
   finding, reported by `consistency_report()` and never clamped: for a
   deuterium fill, a drive parameter outside the documented
   ``[66, 108]`` window of optimised machines; the window is not
   applied to other fill gases.
5. Repository-level `evidence_maturity` = the highest state claimed by
   any capability entry; per-capability states are the authoritative
   claim surface.
6. Everything else is unchanged: review-only/non-actionable SPO
   profile, no adapter implementation, empty solver seams,
   `not_federated` Studio state, independent machine-protection veto,
   all non-claims.

## Consequences

- The Studio descriptor's `capabilities` array carries its first item
  (schema 1.1.0 data change only).
- The reactor-domain validator gains the populated-capabilities branch
  with the ceiling rule.
- Later lanes (current-derivative/neutron diagnostic semantics with the
  thermal/beam separation, safety envelope) build on these types;
  maturity advances per capability only with the evidence the family
  standard requires.
